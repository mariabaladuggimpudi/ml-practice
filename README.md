# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project repository. This project focuses on various machine learning tasks, including predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and neural networks. The repository is organized into the following sections:

- [Predictive Modeling](#predictive-modeling)
- [Time Series Forecasting](#time-series-forecasting)
- [Neural Networks](#neural-networks)

## Predictive Modeling

In the `predictive` folder, you will find implementations of machine learning models for various predictive tasks. These models are designed to make predictions based on input data, such as classification, regression, and clustering. Each subfolder contains specific examples and use cases.

### Examples

- [Classification](predictive/classification/): Implementations of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

- [Regression](predictive/regression/): Regression models like linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting for predicting continuous values.

- [Clustering](predictive/clustering/): Code and examples for clustering algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN.

## Time Series Forecasting

The `forecasting` folder is dedicated to time series forecasting. Time series data often involves predicting future values based on historical observations. In this section, you'll find examples and implementations of forecasting models.

### Examples

- [ARIMA Models](forecasting/arima/): Code for implementing AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, a common choice for time series forecasting.

- [Prophet](forecasting/prophet/): Implementation and examples using Prophet, an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook.

- [LSTM Forecasting](forecasting/lstm/): Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time series forecasting.

## Neural Networks

The `neural_networks` folder contains deep learning models and neural network implementations. Deep learning is used for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

### Examples

- [Image Classification](neural_networks/image_classification/): Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- [Natural Language Processing](neural_networks/nlp/): Implementations of neural networks for natural language processing tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation.

- [Recurrent Neural Networks](neural_networks/rnn/): Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis, such as time series prediction and language modeling.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the sections, navigate to the respective folder and follow the notebook along with the instructions. Currently there is no README file within each subdirectory. But soon there will be a README.md file in each folder.
