# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project repository. This project focuses on various machine learning tasks, including predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and neural networks. The repository is organized into the following sections:

- [Predictive Modeling](#predictive-modeling)
- [Time Series Forecasting](#time-series-forecasting)
- [Neural Networks](#neural-networks)

## Predictive Modeling

In the predictive modeling, you will find the application of machine learning models for various predictive tasks. These models are designed to make predictions based on input data, such as classification, regression, and clustering.

### Examples

- [Classification](classification/): Implementations of classification algorithms.

- [End to End Machine Learning](end_to_end_ml/): Data Preprocessing, Exploration, Applying ML model (Regression).

- [Support Vector Machine](svm/): Application of SVM Classifier.

- [Regression](training_linear_models/): Application of Regression Modeling along with Regularization.

- [Decision Trees](decision_trees/): There are only questions that people generally have when learning about decision trees.

- [Dimensionality Reduction](dimensionality_reduction/): There are only questions that people generally have when learning about decision trees.


## Time Series Forecasting

The forecasting modeling is dedicated to time series forecasting. Time series data often involves predicting future values based on historical observations. In this section, you'll find examples and implementations of forecasting models.

### Examples

- [ARIMA Models](time_series/): Application of AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, a common choice for time series forecasting.

- [Prophet](time_series/): Application and examples using Prophet, an open-source forecasting tool developed by Facebook.

- [LSTM Forecasting](time_series/): Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time series forecasting.

## Neural Networks

The neural_networks modeling contains deep learning models and neural network implementations. Deep learning is used for various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

### Examples

- [Training Deep Neural Networks](training_deep_nn/): Introduction of different problems that occur when training Deep Neural Network.

- [Natural Language Processing](nlp/): Implementations of neural networks for natural language processing tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation.

- [Custom Models and Training](custom_models_n_training/): How to do custom model training, typically when you need more control on your architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the sections, navigate to the respective folder and follow the notebook along with the instructions. Currently there is no README file within each subdirectory. But soon there will be a README.md file in each folder.
